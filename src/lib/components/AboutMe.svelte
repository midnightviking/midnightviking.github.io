	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p> I am a web developer from Indiana. Originally I attended college for Game Design &amp; Development, but was offered a position doing web development after I assisted a professor with one of their work contracts. I have done both design and development through the years, but always end up back on the development side. </p>
	<p>Mostly, I just love to learn. Being a web developer is great because I have to learn constantly to stay apace, but its not the sole subject I enjoy. 
		Physics, cosmology, and biology are some of my favorites to learn from. And there is so much to learn!</p>
	<p><span>When I'm not busy researching curiousities, my time is best filled with pretend dinosaurs &amp; video games alongside my significant other and our {magnus} year old son.</span> </p>
